1. How will you test the changes? 
    Test the changes by deploying sample applications and services in a mirrored staging environment. 
    Perform functional testing to ensure that deployments, user access, and service communications work as expected. 
    Conduct performance tests to monitor resource utilization and simulate load to check for any degradation. 
    Stability testing will include fault tolerance simulations to confirm recovery and verify that integrations and tools remain compatible.

2. How will you ensure the changes don't negatively affect your cluster? 
    Ensure changes donâ€™t impact the cluster by closely monitoring performance and stability metrics during and after implementation. 
    Validate the changes in a production-like environment first to identify any issues before rolling out to live systems. 
    Implement a rollback plan to revert changes if critical issues are detected, and maintain continuous monitoring post-deployment to catch any emerging problem
